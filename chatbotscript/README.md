# Siriraj chatbot assistant application

We create a [Streamlit chatbot interface](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/build-conversational-apps) for interfacing with an assistant.
To run an application, you can do the following:

- Put the CSV of the doctor and their specialization in this folder such as `siriraj_doctor_details.csv`
- Specify `OPENAI_API_KEY` to specify an API key and `FILE_PATH` to specify path to csv file
- Run Streamlit chat application using `streamlit run chatbot_script.py`
